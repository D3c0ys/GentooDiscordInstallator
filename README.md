# GentooDiscordInstallator
this project made from my problem that discord has to update every time!!!!!

this is how to install/update discord from this script
just copy commands below and paste it on your terminal

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3c0ys/GentooDiscordInstallator/main/DiscordInstaller.sh -o DiscordInstaller.sh; chmod +x DiscordInstaller.sh; sudo ./DiscordInstaller.sh
```

edit: just realized it's the same code as Arch Linux Discord installer
so this code would theoretically work for all Linux
